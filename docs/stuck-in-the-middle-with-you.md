# Stuck in the Middle with You

This application has a special route `GET /stuck-in-the-middle`. Unfortunately it
will only respond successfully if a header `X-Stuck-In-The-Middle: no` is
present on the incoming request.


Using the [`StuckInTheMiddleware`][middleware] file, find a way to inject the
`X-Stuck-In-The-Middle` header on the incoming request so that accessing the route
returns successfully.
